# Open Glossary of Edge Computing

The Linux Foundation's [Open Glossary of Edge Computing](./edge-glossary.md) project curates and defines 
terms related to the field of edge computing, collecting common and accepted definitions into an openly 
licensed repository. The Open Glossary project leverages a diverse community of contributors to collaborate 
on a shared lexicon, offering an organization- and vendor-neutral platform for advancing a common understanding 
of edge computing and the next generation Internet.

The Open Glossary is governed as an open source project using a transparent and meritocratic process. 
Anybody can make additions, clarifications and suggestions by raising a GitHub issue or editing a branch 
and issuing a pull request. Each issue or pull request is evaluated by the community for inclusion.
