# Contributing

Everybody is invited to suggest changes, additions and improvements to the Open Glossary of Edge Computing. We employ a community-driven process governed by The Linux Foundation to develop and improve upon this shared lexicon. This glossary provides a vendor-neutral platform on which to organize a shared vocabulary around edge computing and the next generation Internet. Contributions are welcome from all participants who abide by the project's purpose and charter.

Anyone who wishes to make a contribution, may submit a GitHub issue or create a pull request.

## Project Committers

All issues and pull requests are evaluted by the Project Committers. The initial committers are, in alphabetical order:

* Alex Marcham, NetworkArchitecture2020 (alex@NetworkArchitecture2020.com)
* Matt Trifiro, Vapor IO (mtrifiro@vapor.io)
* Edward Vielmetti, Packet (ed@packet.net)

From time to time, the project will consider changing or expanding its committers.

## Technical Steering Committee

The Techncical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for technical oversight of the open source Project, ensuring accuracy and fair play. The TSC consists of

* Chair: Matt Trifiro, Vapor IO (mtrifiro@vapor.io)
* Alex Marcham, NetworkArchitecture2020 (alex@NetworkArchitecture2020.com)
* Wesley Reisz, Section (wesley@section.io)

## Working Groups

Under the auspices of the Glossary project, there are two working groups:

### The Taxonomy Project
The Taxonomy project is led by Alex Marcham (alex@NetworkArchitecture2020.com). It seeks to build a taxonomical guide to edge computing that supports and informs the glossary.

### Landscape Project
The Landscape project is led by Wesley Reisz (wesley@section.io). It seeks to build an interactive landscape map to all of the entities and projects in the edge computing ecosystem.

## Guidelines

- To propose specific changes to a glossary entry, edit that entry in your branch and issue a pull request.
- To request that an entry be clarified, updated or reconsidered, you may alternatively open an issue.
- To propose a new entry to the glossary, either create an issue or, if you have the definition drafted, add the entry to your branch (in its proper alphabetical location) and create a pull request.

## Issues & Pull Requests

- Please jump in and help us out by reviewing open issues and making pull requests to resolve them.
- If you see anything you think can be improved, feel free to open an issue or, even, better submit your suggestions via a pull request.
- Please title your pull requests appropriately, summing up what your commits are about.
- For new terms, make sure that your entry doesn't already exist somewhere else in the glossary.

Requests:

- For glossary entry changes and additions, please raise separate pull requests for each entry. This makes it easier to discuss and shepherd updates in self-contained units.
- Please provide links to third party uses that support your issue or pull request.

## Philosophy

- The Open Glossary of Edge Computing seeks to be concise, including words that are unique to edge computing, or which have different meanings when used in an edge computing context.
- The Glossary does not aspire to be a redundant resource for common words that are defined elsewhere, including general-purpose computing words, such as thost that relate generally to data centers, networking and cloud computing.
- Occasionally, exceptions will be made to include words defined elsewhere. This is especially true when having them in this glossary aids comprehension or improves cross-referencing, especially if the term has an especially important or nuanced meaning in edge environments.

## Descriptive vs Prescriptive

- In most circumstances, the definition of a term should be based on empirical evidence of contemporary usage as published in literature, academic articles, talks and white papers.
- In some cases, a term will suffer from conflation, imprecise usage, or, even worse, outright conflicting defintions. In these cases, the PMC will consider proposed clarifications or focused definitions on a case-by-case basis.
- Occasionally, a new term (or a new definition to an existing term) will need to be invented, such as when there is a need to describe something related to edge computing, or make an important distinction, but where no suitable word exists. In these cases, the PMC will consider the new word or new definition of an existing word based on the prominence of the problem and the workability/elegance of the proposed solution.
